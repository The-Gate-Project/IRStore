-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here a mod introducing a new merchant on the Waukeen Promenade, Nathan, which will give you in exchange for some gold coins rather effective and very useful items and weapons for BG2.

Installation:
 - BG2ToB or BGT, with the last Bioware official patch 26498, or the GOG version which integrates them already.
- BG2EE or EET

Compatibility : 
This mod should be compatible with most of the existing WeiDU mods

The Mod : 
It has been a while that I have among my BG2 installations this very ancient mod, using the obsolete IAP program and realized aeons ago in 2002. It has the advantage to provide interesting items, even particularly useful, to the point that I can't do without it, above all two rings that turn out to be quite frankly indispensable to successfully confront the creatures from beyond the grave. So, I rolled up my sleeves, reworked the mod in a more modern format, tra-ified in the process, and now you can take advantage of the marvelous items that Nathan will sell you. Moreover, I've recovered a weapon which wasn't listed in the original installation and I've expanded its presentation (The Hammer of Tyr).

FAQ :
Where can I find Nathan ?
 On the Waukeen Promenade, code AR0700 - x=2075 y=1220. He will not appear in ToB.
